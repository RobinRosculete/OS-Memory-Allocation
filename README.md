## OS-Memory-Allocation
  - Program to simulate memory allocation using hole-fitting algorithms like First-fit and Best-fit.
  - Program also implements deallocation and defragmentation of memory blocks
## What I learned
  - How to implement First-fit and Best-Fit algorithms
  - How to implement deallocation and defragmentation of memory
  - How to use dynamic memory allocation in C
