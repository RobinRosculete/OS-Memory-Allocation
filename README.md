## OS-Memory-Allocation
 This C program simulates memory allocation using hole-fitting algorithms such as First-fit and Best-fit. It also implements the deallocation and defragmentation of memory blocks.
 
## This program offers the following benefits:

  - Improved understanding of memory management: By simulating the allocation, deallocation, and defragmentation of memory, I gained a deeper understanding of how these processes work and how to optimize them for efficiency.
  - Enhanced problem-solving skills: Implementing the First-fit and Best-Fit algorithms required me to think critically and creatively to find solutions to various challenges.
  - Improved programming skills: Using dynamic memory allocation in C allowed me to practice and improve my coding skills.

Overall, the OS-Memory-Allocation program is a valuable tool for improving my understanding of memory management and enhancing my problem-solving and programming skills.
